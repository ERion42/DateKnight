# Date Knight


## Description

An app that helps plan out a fun and potentially engaging evening using user input and location.

Currently this project is still in the process of being built. We are hoping to get some basic functionality on it soon.

## Installation

To install necessary dependencies, run the following command:

```
npm i
```

## Usage

Currently in development. For personal use only.


## Future Features

Our first goal is to achieve basic functionality with a "stay at home" date night. That means we'll have the ability to choose what to watch, what to eat and how to prepare it, as well as potential drink pairings. By keeping the scope small here, we'll be able to achieve an MVP sooner and can work on expanding to other possibilities.
